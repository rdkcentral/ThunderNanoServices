### Backend
The backend is responsible for bliting the composition to a connector. It holds the framebuffers and controls the GPU. It depends on the ```DRIVER_MODESET``` or ```DRIVER_ATOMIC``` capabilities of the driver there for is should open a cardx node.

### Allocator
Used to allocate buffers in the GPU, this uses the ```DRIVER_GEM``` so it will work both cardx and renderDxxx nodes. 

### Renderer
As the name suggests the renderer will to render Textures to Buffers. This buffers can be any thing that is allocated using IBuffer. the opened node should  have ```DRIVER_RENDER```.
